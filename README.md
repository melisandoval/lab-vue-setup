### Tasks:

* Iteration 1 | Create a new Vue component inside your project and show it on the home screen

* Iteration 2 | Showing data from your JavaScript inside your HTML

* Iteration 3 | Bonus | Create a "Hello World" function that fires when you click on a button

### Iteration 4 | Bonus | Creating two different routes and navigating between them

We'll dive much deeper into the Vue Router module in future lessons; but if you want a new challenge, here's your last task for this lab:

- If you didn't include it during your initial setup, download and configure the Router module. [Here's a link to the official guide](https://github.com/vuejs/router).

Remember you'll only need to install it again if you didn't choose to include it in your project when you created it with the CLI.

- Create a new component and register it as a route. Again, [the documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/) is your best friend here.

- Create a navbar (it can be as simple as two links on the website's top section) that allows you to navigate between your components.
